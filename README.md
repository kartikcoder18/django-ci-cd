## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

This project aims to automate the deployment of a Django application using Docker and Jenkins. We will build a CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous integration and deployment with the following technologies:

- **GitHub**: For version control and code hosting.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the Django application.
- **Jenkins**: For automating the build and deployment process.

---

## âœ… Pre-Requisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Git**: For version control and pushing code to GitHub.
- **Docker**: To containerize the Django application.
- **Jenkins**: To set up the CI/CD pipeline.
- **AWS EC2** (Optional): To host the application.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Implementation

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub, log in, and create a new repository named `django-ci-cd`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```groovy
git clone https://github.com/kartikcoder18/django-ci-cd.git
cd django-ci-cd
```
---

### Step 2: Create Django Project Locally

1. Create a new Django project:
```
django-admin startproject mynotes .
```
2. Create a new Django app named "notes":
```
python manage.py startapp notes
```
3. This will create the basic structure of your Django project and app inside your repository.

---

### Step 3: Create requirements.txt

1. Generate a `requirements.txt` file to list necessary dependencies:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
2. Ensure it includes at least the following dependencies:

```
Django>=4.2
gunicorn
```
---
### Step 4: Dockerize the Django Application
To containerize the Django application, we will use Docker. Follow these steps to create the necessary configuration files and test the container locally.

1. Create a Dockerfile : In your repository's root folder, create a file named Dockerfile with the following content:

```groovy
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the project
COPY . /app/

# Set static folder
RUN mkdir -p /app/static

# Collect static files
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Run migrations and start server
CMD ["sh", "-c", "python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"]
```
2. Create a .dockerignore file
In the root directory of your repository, create a docker-compose.yml file to simplify Docker container management. Add the following content:

```groovy
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.env
db.sqlite3
/static/
```

This configuration:

Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile.

Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 on the container.

Mounts the current directory (.) as a volume to allow live code updates.

3. Build and Test the Docker Container Locally
Once the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are created, run the following command to build and start the container:

```groovy
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will:

Build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile.

Start the application inside the container on port 8000.

4. Access the Application
After the build completes successfully, open your browser and visit:
```groovy
http://localhost:8000
```
You should see your Django application running inside the Docker container.

### Step 5: Implementation of EC2 
1. Create an AWS EC2 Instance

To host the Jenkins server, we first need to create an EC2 instance on AWS.

1. **Login to AWS**:
   - Navigate to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and click on **Launch Instance**.
   - Select the **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** AMI from the list of available Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
   - Choose the **t2.micro** instance type, which is eligible for the free tier.
   - Click **Next: Configure Instance Details** and proceed through the default settings.
   - In the **Configure Security Group** section, create a new security group allowing **SSH (port 22)** for connecting to the instance and **HTTP (port 80)** for web traffic.

3. **Connect to EC2 Instance**:
   - After launching the instance, you can connect to it using SSH. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `<your-key>.pem` with your key file and `<your-ec2-public-ip>` with your instance's public IP address:
   
   ```bash
   ssh -i <your-key>.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
   ```

---

### 2. Update the EC2 Instance

Before installing any packages, ensure that your instance is up-to-date. This practice helps prevent issues related to outdated packages.

1. **Run the following command**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
   This command updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations.

---

### 3. Install Java

Since Jenkins is built using Java, you need to install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to ensure Jenkins runs correctly.

1. **Install OpenJDK 17**:
   - Run the following command to install the latest version of OpenJDK:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
   ```

2. **Verify Java Installation**:
   - Check whether Java is installed by running:
   
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

---

### 4. Install Jenkins

Now that Java is installed, you can proceed to install Jenkins, which will be used to create the CI/CD pipeline.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
   ```

2. **Add Jenkins Key**:
   - Execute the following command to add the Jenkins key:
   
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
   ```

3. **Add Jenkins Repository**:
   - Add the Jenkins repository to your system:
   
   ```bash
   echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
   ```

4. **Update Package Index**:
   - Run the following command to update the package index:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Install Jenkins**:
